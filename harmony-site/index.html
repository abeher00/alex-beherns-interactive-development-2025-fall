    Dear CD player,
    </div>

    <div id="spinningParagraph2">
    They call you outdated, but I think you're magnificent, and intelligent in your design. I adore how you spin CD's, your laser reading the microscopic grooves that make me want to move. You read those disks to me as I work, as I play, and as I sleep, the bright blue of your LED's softly lighting up the room. Those disks contain a language withinin themselves that I cannot read, so I admire how you can play them with ease, keeping the quality of the songs safe in the heart of your chasis.
    May you play evermore.
    </div>

    <div id="spinningParagraph3">
    Love, Alex.
